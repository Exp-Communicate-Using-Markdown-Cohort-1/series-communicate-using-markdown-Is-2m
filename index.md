![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)
I read `Yaktocat` as `Yokata` (please don't judge me i was in a hurry to complete this ass-ignment :v )
and `Yokata` sounded in my head as `wakata` which means `I got it` or `understood` in Japanese
Idk why i'm still explaining this filth while I'm already in a hurry to end this ðŸ˜ž
